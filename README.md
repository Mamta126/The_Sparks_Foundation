# **Prediction using Machine Learning**
# TOPIC - To predict the percentage of students based on their study hours

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and prediction project that explores the fascinating relationship between study hours and students' academic percentages. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, we delve into data wrangling, preprocessing, and captivating exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visually appealing graphs and heatmaps.

## **Introduction**
This project aims to analyze the correlation between study hours and students' academic percentages using machine learning techniques. By developing a Linear Regression model with scikit-learn, we can accurately estimate students' percentages based on their study hours. Additionally, we calculate the slope of the regression line to gain deeper insights into the impact of study hours on academic success.

## **Results**
The results of this project include various visualizations and predictive insights. These results are stored in the results directory and include:

### **Exploratory Data Analysis:-**
**Graphs**: A figure containing visually appealing graphs showcasing the relationship between study hours and students' academic percentages.
**Heatmaps**: A figure depicting heatmaps illustrating the correlation between study hours and academic percentages.\
**ML Model**: A serialized version of the trained Linear Regression
